# CFB-Poll-v0.1 based on CFBPoll 4.0 by TheAlpacalypse - The Pandas Rewrite 

This update to the CFBPoll allows the computer to pull data from (https://collegefootballdata.com/) The aim of this is to make the poll easier to maintain and keep updated.

Computerized poll to automatically rank college football teams each week
First install the dependencies using the command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run the program using the command:

`python3 __main__.py`

Use `Constants.py` to tweak the values I use to generate the ranking. I have tried to avoid leaving any raw values in this main program to let users experiment.
